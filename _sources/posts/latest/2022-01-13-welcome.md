# Welcome to the PuPPy blog

[_Jacob Deppen_](https://deppen8.github.io)

The [Puget Sound Programming Python (PuPPy)](https://www.pspython.com/) community includes some of the brightest and kindest people I have met. Pre-pandemic (and hopefully again in the future), PuPPy hosted a vibrant series of [Meetups](https://www.meetup.com/PSPPython/): monthly talk nights, interview practice nights, programming nights, special interest groups (machine learning, scientific Python, natural language processing), and more. Since those events have gone away, the community has not had a good forum for sharing with the world. A blog is an imperfect replacement for those events, but I hope that it might fill a small part of the gap by giving people an outlet for sharing their projects, their expertise, and their perspectives.

Another motivating force for the blog is the PuPPy Slack community. While in-person events have been paused, the [PuPPy Slack](http://slack.pspython.com/) continues on as a digital gathering place for the community. This busy Slack workspace, with over 3,200 members in the `#general` channel, sees all kinds of conversations and Q&A that contain incredibly high-level knowledge and thoughtful perspectives on Python, tech, and more. However, all of this community knowledge disappears quite quickly with the message limit of Slack's free tier. I hope that by encouraging people to share on the blog, we can better preserve that communal knowledge base.

And who am I? I am a data scientist who gets a big kick out of [teaching, learning, and community](https://deppen8.github.io).
