# A PuPPy Slack Primer

_Jacob Deppen_

Since 2015, the [PuPPy Slack](http://slack.pspython.com/) has been the online gathering place to keep the community connected between in-person meetings. Since the spring of 2020, when in-person Meetups were halted, the PuPPy Slack workspace has become the main forum for staying engaged with the rest of the community. The Slack workspace has more than 3,200 members and over 150 channels (as of January 2022), so when new people join, it can be a bit overwhelming and difficult to find the channels that fit their particular interests. This post is a quick summary of some of the more popular channels as well as some fun niche channels.

```{admonition} Caveat
:class: attention

This is obviously biased by my personal experience and the channels that I frequent. There are certainly other interesting channels worthy of your attention.

A great way to find "your people" is to say hello in a channel like `#random` and tell folks what you are interested in.
```

## General interest

`#general`
: The only required channel (though you can still mute it). Great for items of interest to the whole community: big news in the Python world, conference announcements, etc.

`#q-and-a`
: In my opinion, the most valuable channel. If you have a Python question, there are probably folks in this channel who can help. They might not have _all_ the answers, but if not, they are the best [rubber ducks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) you can find. I have learned an incredible amount just from reading PuPPy `#q-and-a`.

`#random`
: A place for everything else. If there is something you think people might be interested in but aren't sure what channel it might fit in, `#random` is a good bet.

`#ragepile`
: Programming and the tech world more broadly <strike>can be</strike> are frustrating. We all need a place to vent. Drop it in `#ragepile`. My "favorite" recent rage:

  >At work, there is a committee that has to approve slack emoji.

  Oof.

`#gratitudepile`
: Not _everything_ is terrible. A recent exemplar that we can all get behind:

  >naps

## For jobseekers

`#jobs`
: The main outlet for job postings and general items about employment.

`#resume_feedback`
: Get extra sets of eyes on your rÃ©sumÃ©. Many people in the channel have experience hiring for Python jobs and have seen lots of good and bad rÃ©sumÃ©s. Posting something for feedback from a group of strangers might be intimidating, but PuPPy folks are constructive and want to help!

  ```{note}
  This channel has gone much quieter than it used to be. I'm not sure why that might be, but there are still over 300 members who can help out.
  ```

`#interview_prep_night`
: In the Before Times, there was a regular PuPPy Meetup where folks could get interview advice and practice with mock interviews. While these sessions haven't been happening recently, this channel is still full of knowledgeable folks who can provide interview prep help.

## Data

As a data scientist, these are some of the channels I frequent for data topics.

`#machine-learning`
: For all kinds of machine learning discussions. If you have machine learning questions, this channel can be even better than `#q-and-a` because some folks have big channels like `#q-and-a` muted.

`#pandask`
: Discussions related to the `pandas`/`numpy`/`dask`/etc. ecosystem. Ask us how you can refactor that `df.apply()`.

`#scientific_computing`
: For anything at the intersection of science and computing. Great for folks using Python as part of academic research.

`#data-visualization`
: "Stop me from making a pie chart."

## Just for fun

`#fooding`
: Sharing and admiring food. Homemade triumphs, inedible failures, the greatest new restaurants, and everything in between.

`#music`
: What are you listening to?

`#punpy`
: For all those eyeroll-inducing puns that you can't keep to yourself.

`#wordle`
: A recent addition! Share your path to ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©.

`#adventofcode`
: A place to discuss the yearly [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) coding challenges.

## Lightning round!

These are popular channels that I am not a member of but sound great.

`#docker`
: Get help figuring out why your laptop is draining battery even though it is plugged in.

`#keyboard`
: _click-click-click-click-click_

`#gardening`
: Going outside is important too!

`#gaming`
: Lots of video game chat, but tabletop games as well.

`#cat-holics` and `#doggo`
: I picture these as the Sharks and the Jets of the PuPPy Slack...probably.

`#golang` and `#rustaceans`
: For the polyglots.
