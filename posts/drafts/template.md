## Jupyter Book features

See the [Jupyter Book documentation](https://jupyterbook.org/content/index.html) to see some of the additional built-in features.

### Sub-header

Using sub-headers is important for letting Jupyter Book add a floating Contents menu to the right side of the page. Don't skip levels! In other words, if you have a `###`, make sure there is a `##` before it.
